When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would want to use a remote repository when I want to share my work with
    other people or even just as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatic updates would be too unpredictable when different people can push
    changes to the same remote repository. Someone's local repository could get
    updated at the wrong time. It's best to always pull changes manually, so
    that we can decide when we're ready to integrate them.
